L00176857_ChessDetectionPipeline.ipynb is the working model.

I did not achieve tracking of piece movements but have some success with mapping pieces to chessboard squares.
Results for square mapping and piece-to-square mapping are on the JSON files.

I included my training models for tensorflow, YOLO v5 & v8 as a testament of trial and error. 
I have several model configurations for each of the three.
